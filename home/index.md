# General Idea

In this project, our goal is to work as a team to create an
interesting game, which will contain all the elements of gaming
detailed in our course, COMP 4970/7970.  We have decided on a concept
for a game, which will feature a fast paced series of mini-games which
will be played on a mobile platform, with possible multiplayer
implementation. The game will have uniformity in its theme of
nature. Each mini-game will relate to a characterâ€™s travels through a
forest for continuity. The gameplay will be similar to games like
Warioware Inc., Fusion Frenzy, and Mario party, where there are many
stages. Each stage will feature a different and unique gameplay, but
they will all attribute to an overall goal. An interesting design
aspect of our game is we plan to use the built-in sensors found in
most cellphones (accelerometers, gyroscopes, compass, or even camera)
to interact with the stages. All of these things combined will make
the game more interesting. The elements of a uniformed environment
will allow players to get engrossed in our game, the quick style of
play and learning will allow for a wide demographic, and the use of
mobile sensors will prevent players from getting bored.
