<p>In this project, our goal is to work as a team to create an interesting game, which will contain all the elements of gaming detailed in our course, COMP 4970/7970. We have decided on a concept for a game, which will feature a fast paced series of mini-games which will be played on a mobile platform, with possible multiplayer implementation. The game will have uniformity in its theme of nature. Each mini-game will relate to a characterâ€™s travels through a forest for continuity. The gameplay will be similar to games like Warioware Inc., Fusion Frenzy, and Mario party, where there are many stages. Each stage will feature a different and unique gameplay, but they will all attribute to an overall goal. An interesting design aspect of our game is we plan to use the built-in sensors found in most cellphones (accelerometers, gyroscopes, compass, or even camera) to interact with the stages. All of these things combined will make the game more interesting. The elements of a uniformed environment will allow players to get engrossed in our game, the quick style of play and learning will allow for a wide demographic, and the use of mobile sensors will prevent players from getting bored.</p>
